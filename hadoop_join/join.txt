Use PIG /HIVE for joins ., becuase writing joins in map reduce is STONEAGE Technology and we dont live in stone AGE
But in theory it supports Two types of data sets one that are Ordered and partitioned and sorted , like output of a reducer 
and the other Joining unordered and non partitioned .
Either way its a headache. Unordered being a nightmare
 All the major autors suggest moving away from MR-Code for joins and move to PIG/HIVE
