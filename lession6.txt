custom partitioner
the exampel is from http://hadooptutorial.wikispaces.com/Custom+partitioner
We already written cusotm partitioner as part of lession 5 secoundary sort where we overwrite get partitions methos by extending partioner class

This perticuler example shows how we cna use custom partitioner ot solve a differnet type of problem
We will nto dig into this becuase it sjust repeat of the other
points ot remember
The number of partitions is equal to the number of reducers
overwrite Partitioner class getpartitions method 
Reducer and partitiners get inpu data form MApper context.write
Finally we use setPartitionerclass in job
