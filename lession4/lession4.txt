combiner 
Using combiners... The only thing to know is
we cat use combiners everywhere only to reduce map keys / 
In most of the cases the reducer class is set to be the combiner class. The difference lies in the output from these classes. The output of the combiner class is the intermediate data that is passed to the reducer whereas the output of the reducer is passed to the output file on disk.
 The combiner function runs on the output of the map phase and is used as a filtering or an aggregating step to lessen the number of intermediate keys that are being passed to the reducer.

*warning cant use combiners everywhere - example 5+10+20/3 =11.6 is not equal to
15/2  =7.5+20/2 =13.75
so it should be cumilative and associative both to apply ocmbiners

Reference : using the code posted by @bbejeck on GitHub  Or better version vangjee wordpres blog we see how combiner code can be used within the MApper 

1) Just telling mapreduce to use reducer as combiners
2) combiing wordcount for everymap call - collect in map and count all values before emitting 
3) combining wordcount in map and emitting at the end of map do the same in cleanup and use map.clear() after everycall to prevent memory run out

A Custom combiner is different form the reducer wherein this filters data or changes output of mapper and emits the values which are same type as mapper to the reducer this reducer class wil be set in driver as setcombinerClass

So the most simplistic implementation is to take ht eoutputof mapper and do some filtering of data based on key or a value. 

A Complex implementation would be to read Graph Twiddling in a MapReduce World by J Cohen  and implement this

in the simple mplimentation here we put the filter expression as Berners-Lee and in output we see the result does not include this
we might ave as well used a jobconfig variable that we pass @runtime and filter the values passed during runtime -D option
as we have seen in lession3 implementation of grep
