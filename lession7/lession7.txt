To read a delimited file 
1- write a custom mapper by writing custom fileinput format by extending FileInputFormat<LongWritable, Text> and overwriting RecordReader<LongWritable, Text>
, isSplitable(JobContext context, Path file) 
AND
By providing custom recordreader whos job is to use data within split to create  key value pairs

i.e use a loop to add lines untill record delim is found in the split 

Another task is to read multipel inputs from different mappers wiht different input format by same reducer

use MultipleInputs.addInputPath(job, firstPath, FirstInputFormat.class, FirstMap.class);
	MultipleInputs.addInputPath(job, sencondPath, SecondInputFormat.class, SecondMap.class);
where FirstInputFormat.class and SecondInputFormat.class are both custom input formats 
and
It has 2 differnt mappers it uses to read two files
